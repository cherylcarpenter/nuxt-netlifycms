# nuxt-netlifycms

## Stack

This is going to be my personal website.

I started with Nuxt, Vue 3, Tailwind, Netlify, Netlify CMS, and added Storybook.  
My Netlify CMS has been configured to use a local editing dashboard.

Now I'm adding prebuilt components from a wonderful free theme by
[Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/)  
[Vue Notus](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/vue-notus)

I'm going to deploy both the CMS version and the storybook version with Netlify

TODO

<ul>
<li>Wire the stories with fake data /or CMS data, undecided</li>
<li>Create data structure in Netlify CMS</li>
<li>Create pages with new or existing components</li>
<li>Customize Tailwind for my own design</li>
<li>Customize the local dashboard for CMS editing</li>
